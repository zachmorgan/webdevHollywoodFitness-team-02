                <p>Hollywood Fitness | Project Description
                <br /><span class="team_two">Team Two Web Co.</span> 
                <br />February 19, 2014</p>
            </div>

            <p><span class="team_two">Team Two Web Co.</span> understands that Hollywood Fitness is looking for a redesign of current website to reflect an exciting and inviting appeal in a clean and professional manner. It is our goal to create a web presence that will focus on getting people to “sign up for (Fitpro) newsletter or a 7 day membership” as a primary goal.</p>

            <p>In addition, we will place emphasis on “how much fun and success people have at club”. Team Two will include a call to action for local businesses by offering cross marketing research through flyers and discounts.</p>

            <p class="list_title"><span class="team_two">Team Two</span> is committed to providing the right solution for Hollywood Fitness in the following ways:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Complete transfer of all existing content from current website to new one. We are available to edit copy for existing content and write copy for specific content areas that will be implemented in the new website. Once the website is handed to the client, <span class="team_two">Team Two</span> will no longer be responsible for the editing, updating, and writing of any content pertaining to Hollywood Fitness.</li>
                <li>Design an interface that is more exiting and appealing to new members with two full revisions within an agreed upon timeframe. Team Two understands that the current brand must be preserved and relevant to the new design. </li>
                <li>Per request, the website will be developed in WordPress with a maximum of 8 pages. Hollywood Fitness has expressed an interest in a slider menu and video/photo galleries. Team Two will implement these features in a way that is easy for Hollywood Fitness’ content editor to update.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="list_title">Within these 8 pages <span class="team_two">Team Two</span> will:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Represent Hollywood Fitness’ Rewards Program.</li>
                <li>Discuss the ActivTracs Program and allow members to login if they have an account.</li>
                <li>Describe the Personal Training program, it’s appeal, and introduce the Personal Trainers on staff. </li>
                <li>Display calendar of Events, Group X training, Yoga, and Dance</li>
                <li>Incorporate media gallery for videos and photos.</li>
                <li>Transfer blog articles and include social network “sharing” options</li>
                <li>Provide easily accessible contact information including hours of operation and social media links: Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and Google +.</li>
                <li>Provide space for user reviews found on other websites such as Yelp</li>
                <li>Incorporate slider of photos that highlight gym features plus call to action regarding newsletter and membership program</li>
            </ol>

            <p>User friendliness is our goal for both Hollywood Fitness and its website users. For this reason, Team Two will provide a user testing session with the client before hand-off. If there are any deficiencies in functionality or user intuitiveness, we will fix them.</p>

            <p>Beyond this we will provide a training session for the client who is responsible for updating the website. Adequate documentation will be provided wherever needed.</p>

            <p class="list_title"><span class="team_two">Team Two</span> is not responsible for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Generation photos</li>
                <li>Photo enhancement or manipulation</li>
                <li>Writing content for non-approved areas</li>
                <li>Content writing beyond send-off</li>
                <li>Writing blog entries on behalf of Hollywood Fitness</li>
                <li>Copyright infringement derived from client-provided content.</li>
                <li>Providing third-party advertisements.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If Hollywood Fitness agrees with <span class="team_two">Team Two’s</span> aforementioned terms and project description, <span class="team_two">Team Two’s</span> will construct a timeline (for both parties) and budget/payment schedule. Once both have been signed off, <span class="team_two">Team Two’s</span> will begin the redesign of Hollywood Fitness’ website according to schedule.</p>
